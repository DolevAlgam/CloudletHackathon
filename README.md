# CloudletHackathon
Full Application Version Control

Welcome, in this repository we will save all the code for the demo.<br>
Although the benefits of saving multiple services on one repository, we are all working simultaneously - that means problems can occur.
To avoid such problems we need to follow two guidelines.
  * Communication - everyone should know what your are working on, you should ask if any one is working on something before accessing that code.
  
  * Format - there is a simple yet important format that describes the way we save and organize our code. You are welcome to criticize and offer new ways of work, but you must follow the format the team has decided on.
  
## Code Foramt

- Main Repo
